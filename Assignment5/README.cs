Rat Race: Savanna is a game where the player has 2 minutes to escape a dreamlike maze 
on the savanna and could potentially kill enemy objects (killing isnâ€™t necessary to win the game).
They need to find the oasis so they can drink water and avoid death from dehydration. 
Use WASD to move and spacebar to shoot enemies.
